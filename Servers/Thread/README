# Project structure:
    ## --> Servers: Contains all the necessary files to generate the Servers
    ## --> Dockerfile: File used to generate the Docker image
    ## --> dockerFifo: Create the docker image and container
    ## --> deleteDockerFifo: delete the docker image and container

# Step by Step instructions:
    ## --> Creating Docker container:
        ### --> First of all make sure the project is properly constructed, you can make the project with the Makefile contained inside "Servers" directory (sudo make server)
        ### --> Run bash file named createDocker.sh
    ## --> Running Daemon
        ### --> you can use the flag '-i' to go inside the container. If createDocker.sh is complete successfully yo will be inside.
        ### --> You can also go inside the docker container with the command "sudo docker exec -t -i server<servername> /bin/bash"
    ## --> Deleting Daemon 
        ### --> To delete the docker you can use deleteDocker.sh bash file.

# Running OS:
    ## --> For this test Ubuntu 18.04 were used and tested.

# Changing ports:
    ## --> Change the config file config.conf
    ## --> change the createdocker.sh HOSTIP and DOCKERIP for the new ports used.

# Docker exposure:
    ## --> Docker will be exposed under this url 'http://<hostip>:<server_port>, where hostip is the ip direction of the host and server_port is the diferrent listening port of the server
